https://github.com/mypyc/mypyc  
https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/cython_tutorial.html  

## 1. Intro

### Key Differences:  
- Code compiled using mypyc is often much faster than CPython since it does these things differently.

- Mypyc generates C that is compiled to native code, instead of compiling to interpreted byte code, which CPython uses. Interpreted byte code always has some interpreter overhead, which slows things down.

### High-level Overview of Mypyc
- Mypyc compiles a Python module (or a set of modules) to C, and compiles the generated C to a Python C extension module (or modules). You can compile only a subset of your program to C -- compiled and interpreted code can freely and transparently interact. You can also freely use any Python libraries (including C extensions) in compiled code.

- Mypyc will only make compiled code faster. To see a significant speedup, you must make sure that most of the time is spent in compiled code -- and not in libraries, for example.

## 2. Simple Usages Compared

### Simple usage of mypyc  

Summary:   
Below, we see up to 30x faster runtime for fibonacci example; but on the other hand, when we use a library (e.g. random) we do not see any improved performance (Note: These are initial tests, not to be taken as conclusive results)  

// test.py
```py
import random, time

# Using type hints
def fib1(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib1(n - 2) + fib1(n - 1)
# NOT using type hints
def fib2(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fib2(n - 2) + fib2(n - 1)

# Using type hints
def sum_of_floats_1() -> float:
    sum: float = 0.0
    for i in range(100_000):
        sum += random.uniform(-10.0, 10.0)
    return (sum)

# NOT using type hints
def sum_of_floats_2():
    sum = 0.0
    for i in range(100_000):
        sum += random.uniform(-10.0, 10.0)
    return (sum)    

t0 = time.time()
fib1(32)
print("fib1: ", time.time()-t0, "sec(s)")
t0 = time.time()
fib2(32)
print("fib2: ", time.time()-t0, "sec(s)")

t0 = time.time()
sum_of_floats_1()
print("sum_of_floats_1: ", time.time()-t0, "sec(s)\n")
t0 = time.time()
sum_of_floats_2()
print("sum_of_floats_2: ", time.time()-t0, "sec(s)\n")
```

// Steps
```
// Compile with mypyc
mypyc test.py // creates: test.cp37-win_amd64.pyd, this is actually a dll file
              // See Note-1 below

// With mypc
python3 -c "import test"
fib1:  0.03400.. sec(s)   // 30x faster (using type hints)
fib2:  0.25001.. sec(s)   //  3x faster (NOT using type hints)
// Without mypyc
python3 test.py
fib1:  0.89505.. sec(s)  // (using type hints)
fib2:  0.89005.. sec(s)  // (NOT using type hints)

// With mypc
python3 -c "import test"
sum_of_floats_1:  0.03000.. sec(s)  // No big difference! (NOT using type hints)
sum_of_floats_2:  0.02800.. sec(s)  // No big difference! (using type hints)
// Without mypyc
python3 test.py
sum_of_floats_1:  0.02900.. sec(s) // (using type hints)
sum_of_floats_2:  0.02900.. sec(s) // (NOT using type hints)

```
